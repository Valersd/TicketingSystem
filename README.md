# TicketingSystem
ASP.NET MVC Project - TA 2013

You are assigned to design and implement a Ticketing System where visitors (without authentication) should be able to view most commented tickets, as well as to register and login in the system. Registered users (after login) should be able to view, comment, search and send tickets (e.g. bug reports). Administrators should have full CRUD operations on categories and comments.
